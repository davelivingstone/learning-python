# learning-python
I am teaching myself Python. This repository contains files that will tell the story of my journey.
I don't have a technical background, as I have a BA in English and French Language and Literature and an MA in Anglo-American Cultural Studies, but I have a deep love of creating things from scratch in general and a fascination with coding in particular. I love learning languages and I find that learning programming languages isn't all that different.
I used to draw and write a lot when I was younger, and I think this passion for creating something out of nothing is what drives me towards programming.
